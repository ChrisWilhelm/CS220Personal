This code is designed to represent a Queue. In CQueue.cpp and CQueue.h, the Queue's data is only chars, and in Queue.h and Queue.inc, the Queue's data can be any type and the Queue can be sorted or not depending on the boolean useDataAsPriority. Besides those differences the Queue's function is mostly the same ways. In Enqueue and operator+ overload, the Queue's that are sorted will insert the new data/Queue's data at points at which the data will remain sorted, otherwise, if it is CQueue or a nonsorted Queue, the data will just be added to the end. Other than this, the two Queue's function the same. They are structured as linked lists used the type _Node to point to the next element and contain the data. Their default constrructor sets the _head to be a nullptr and the constructor can use any data for its construction(so long as it matches the type). There is a destructor to free all memory used. Along with this there is a Dequeue function to remove first data point, operator== to check if the Queue's are equal, operator= to set one Queue's data equal to another through deep copy. operator<< to add an element(just an Enqueue) and operator>> to remove first just as Dequeue. Finally, there is a friend function operator<< that allows us to print an entire queue.
